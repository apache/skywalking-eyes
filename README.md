## Usage

You can use License-Eye in GitHub Actions or in your local machine.

### GitHub Actions

To use License-Eye in GitHub Actions, add a step in your GitHub workflow.

```yaml
- name: Check License Header
  uses: apache/skywalking-eyes@main      # always prefer to use a revision instead of `main`.
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # needed only when you want License-Eye to comment on the pull request.
  # with:
      # Optional: set the log level. The default value is `info`.
      # log: debug
      # Optional: set the config file. The default value is `.licenserc.yaml`.
      # config: .licenserc.yaml
```

Add a `.licenserc.yaml` in the root of your project, for Apache Software Foundation projects, the following configuration should be enough.

```yaml
header:
  license:
    spdx-id: Apache-2.0
    copyright-owner: Apache Software Foundation

  paths-ignore:
    - 'dist'
    - 'licenses'
    - '**/*.md'
    - 'LICENSE'
    - 'NOTICE'

  comment: on-failure
```

**NOTE**: The full configurations can be found in [the configuration section](#configurations).

### Docker Image

```shell
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace apache/skywalking-eyes header check
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace apache/skywalking-eyes header fix
```

### Docker Image from the latest codes

For users and developers who want to help to test the latest codes on main branch, we publish Docker image to GitHub
Container Registry for every commit in main branch, tagged with the commit sha, if it's the latest commit in main
branch, it's also tagged with `latest`.

**Note**: these Docker images are not official Apache releases. For official releases, please refer to
[the download page](https://skywalking.apache.org/downloads/#SkyWalkingEyes) for executable binary and
[the Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/skywalking-eyes) for Docker images.

```shell
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace ghcr.io/apache/skywalking-eyes/license-eye header check
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace ghcr.io/apache/skywalking-eyes/license-eye header fix
```

### Compile from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes
cd skywalking-eyes
make build
```

If you have Go SDK installed, you can also use `go install` command to install the latest code.

```bash
go install github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/cmd/license-eye@latest
```

#### Check License Header

```bash
bin/darwin/license-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_check.yaml header check

INFO Loading configuration from file: test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_check.yaml
INFO Totally checked 30 files, valid: 12, invalid: 12, ignored: 6, fixed: 0
ERROR the following files don't have a valid license header:
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.go
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.graphql
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.ini
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.java
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.md
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.php
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.py
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.sh
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.yaml
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.yml
test/testdata/test-spdx-asf.yaml
test/testdata/test-spdx.yaml
exit status 1
```

#### Fix License Header

```bash
bin/darwin/license-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_fix.yaml header fix

INFO Loading configuration from file: test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_fix.yaml
INFO Totally checked 20 files, valid: 10, invalid: 10, ignored: 0, fixed: 10
```

#### Resolve Dependencies' licenses

This command serves as assistance for human beings to audit the dependencies license, it's exit code is always 0.

You can also use the `--output` or `-o` to save the dependencies' `LICENSE` files to a specified directory so that
you can put them in distribution package if needed.

```bash
bin/darwin/license-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_check.yaml dep resolve -o ./dependencies/licenses
INFO GITHUB_TOKEN is not set, license-eye won't comment on the pull request
INFO Loading configuration from file: test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_check.yaml

#### Check Dependencies' licenses

This command can be used to perform automatic license compatibility check, when there is incompatible licenses found,
the command will exit with status code 1 and fail the command.

```bash
bin/darwin/license-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_check.yaml dep check

INFO Loading configuration from file: .licenserc.yaml

1. The `header` section is configurations for source codes license header.
2. The [SPDX ID](https://spdx.org/licenses/) of the license, it’s convenient when your license is standard SPDX license, so that you can simply specify this identifier without copying the whole license `content` or `pattern`. This will be used as the content when `fix` command needs to insert a license header.
3. The copyright owner to replace the `[owner]` in the `SPDX-ID` license template.
4. If you are not using the standard license text, you can paste your license text here, this will be used as the content when `fix` command needs to insert a license header, if both `license` and `SPDX-ID` are specified, `license` wins.
5. The `pattern` is an optional regexp. You don’t need this if all the file headers are the same as `license` or the license of `SPDX-ID`, otherwise you need to compose a pattern that matches your license texts.
6. The `paths` are the path list that will be checked (and fixed) by license-eye, default is `['**']`. Formats like `**/*`.md and `**/bin/**` are supported.
7. The `paths-ignore` are the path list that will be ignored by license-eye. By default, `.git` and the content in `.gitignore` will be inflated into the `paths-ignore` list.
8. On what condition License-Eye will comment the check results on the pull request, `on-failure`, `always` or `never`. Options other than `never` require the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to be set.
9. `dependency` section is configurations for resolving dependencies' licenses.
10. `files` are the files that declare the dependencies of a project, typically, `go.mo` in Go project, `pom.xml` in maven project, and `package.json` in NodeJS project. If it's a relative path, it's relative to the `.licenserc.yaml`.

**NOTE**: When the `SPDX-ID` is Apache-2.0 and the owner is Apache Software foundation, the content would be [a dedicated license](https://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html#headers) specified by the ASF, otherwise, the license would be [the standard one](https://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html#Apply-My-Software).

## Supported File Types

The `header check` command theoretically supports all kinds of file types, while the supported file types of `header fix` command can be found [in this YAML file](assets/languages.yaml). In the YAML file, if the language has a non-empty property `comment_style_id`, and the comment style id is declared in [the comment styles file](assets/styles.yaml), then the language is supported by `fix` command.

- [assets/languages.yaml](assets/languages.yaml)

  ```yaml
  Java:
    type: programming
    tm_scope: source.java
    ace_mode: java
    codemirror_mode: clike
    codemirror_mime_type: text/x-java
    color: "#b07219"
    extensions:
      - ".java"
    language_id: 181
    comment_style_id: SlashAsterisk
  ```

- [assets/styles.yaml](assets/styles.yaml)

  ```yaml
  - id: SlashAsterisk     # (i)
    start: '/*'           # (ii)
    middle: ' *'          # (iii)
    end: ' */'            # (iv)
  ```

  1. The `comment_style_id` used in [assets/languages.yaml](assets/languages.yaml).
  2. The leading characters of the starting of a block comment.
  3. The leading characters of the middle lines of a block comment.
  4. The leading characters of the ending line of a block comment.

## Technical Documentation

- There is an [activity diagram](./docs/header_fix_logic.svg) explaining the implemented license header
  fixing mechanism in-depth. The diagram's source file can be found [here](./docs/header_fix_logic.plantuml).

## Contribution

- If you find any file type should be supported by the aforementioned configurations, but it's not listed there, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/pulls) to add the configuration into the two files.
- If you find the license template of an SPDX ID is not supported, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/pulls) to add it into [the template folder](assets/header-templates).
