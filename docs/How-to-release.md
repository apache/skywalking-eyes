# Apache SkyWalking Eyes Release Guide

This documentation guides the release manager to release the SkyWalking Eyes in the Apache Way, and also helps people to check the release for voting.

## Prerequisites

1. Close (if finished, or move to next milestone otherwise) all issues in the current milestone from [skywalking-eyes](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/milestones) and [skywalking](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/milestones), create a new milestone if needed.
1. Update [CHANGES.md](../CHANGES.md).


## Add your GPG public key to Apache svn

1. Upload your GPG public key to a public GPG site, such as [MIT's site](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/). 

1. Log in [id.apache.org](https://id.apache.org/) and submit your key fingerprint.

1. Add your GPG public key into [SkyWalking GPG KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/skywalking/KEYS) file, **you can do this only if you are a PMC member**.  You can ask a PMC member for help. **DO NOT override the existed `KEYS` file content, only append your key at the end of the file.**


## Build and sign the source code package

```shell
export VERSION=<the version to release>

git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:apache/skywalking-eyes && cd skywalking-eyes
git tag -a "v$VERSION" -m "Release Apache SkyWalking-Eyes $VERSION"
git push --tags

make clean 

make test # this is optional, it runs sanity checks to verify the features

make release
```

## Upload to Apache svn

```bash
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/skywalking/
mkdir -p skywalking/eyes/"$VERSION"
cp skywalking-eyes/skywalking*.tgz skywalking/eyes/"$VERSION"

## Vote Check

All PMC members and committers should check these before voting +1:

1. Features test.
1. All artifacts in staging repository are published with `.asc`, `.md5`, and `sha` files.
1. Source codes and distribution packages (`skywalking-eyes-src-$VERSION.tgz`)
are in `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/skywalking/eyes/$VERSION` with `.asc`, `.sha512`.
1. `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` are in source codes and distribution package.
1. Check `shasum -c skywalking-eyes-src-$VERSION.tgz.sha512`.
1. Check `gpg --verify skywalking-eyes-src-$VERSION.tgz.asc skywalking-eyes-src-$VERSION.tgz`.
1. Build distribution from source code package by following this [the build guide](#build-and-sign-the-source-code-package).
1. Licenses check, `make license`.

Vote result should follow these:

1. PMC vote is +1 binding, all others is +1 no binding.

1. Within 72 hours, you get at least 3 (+1 binding), and have more +1 than -1. Vote pass. 

1. **Send the closing vote mail to announce the result**.  When count the binding and no binding votes, please list the names of voters. An example like this:

   ```
   [RESULT][VOTE] Release Apache SkyWalking Eyes version $VERSION
   
   72+ hours passed, we’ve got ($NUMBER) +1 bindings (and ... +1 non-bindings):
   
   (list names)
   +1 bindings:
   xxx
   ...
   
   +1 non-bindings:
   xxx
   ...
    
   Thank you for voting, I’ll continue the release process.
   ```
