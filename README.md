## Usage

You can use License-Eye in GitHub Actions or in your local machine.

### GitHub Actions

To use License-Eye in GitHub Actions, add a step in your GitHub workflow.

```yaml
- name: Check License Header
  uses: apache/skywalking-eyes@main      # always prefer to use a revision instead of `main`.
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # needed only when you want License-Eye to comment on the pull request.
```

Add a `.licenserc.yaml` in the root of your project, for Apache Software Foundation projects, the following configuration should be enough.

```yaml
header:
  license:
    spdx-id: Apache-2.0
    copyright-owner: Apache Software Foundation

  paths-ignore:
    - 'dist'
    - 'licenses'
    - '**/*.md'
    - 'LICENSE'
    - 'NOTICE'

  comment: on-failure
```

**NOTE**: The full configurations can be found in [the configuration section](#configurations).

### Docker Image

```shell
$ docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace apache/skywalking-eyes header check
$ docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace apache/skywalking-eyes header fix
```

### Compile from Source

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes
$ cd skywalking-eyes
$ make build
```

#### Check License Header

```bash
$ bin/darwin/license-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_fix.yaml header check

INFO Loading configuration from file: test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test.yaml
INFO Totally checked 23 files, valid: 8, invalid: 8, ignored: 7, fixed: 0
ERROR The following files don't have a valid license header:
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.go
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.graphql

test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.sh
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.yaml
test/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.yml
exit status 1
```

#### Fix License Header

```bash
$ bin/darwin/license-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_fix.yaml header fix

INFO Loading configuration from file: test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_fix.yaml
INFO Totally checked 16 files, valid: 7, invalid: 8, ignored: 1, fixed: 8
```

#### Resolve Dependencies' licenses

```bash
$ bin/darwin/license-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_check.yaml dep resolve
INFO GITHUB_TOKEN is not set, license-eye won't comment on the pull request
INFO Loading configuration from file: test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_check.yaml

1. The `header` section is configurations for source codes license header.
2. The [SPDX ID](https://spdx.org/licenses/) of the license, it’s convenient when your license is standard SPDX license, so that you can simply specify this identifier without copying the whole license `content` or `pattern`. This will be used as the content when `fix` command needs to insert a license header.
3. The copyright owner to replace the `[owner]` in the `SPDX-ID` license template.
4. If you are not using the standard license text, you can paste your license text here, this will be used as the content when `fix` command needs to insert a license header, if both `license` and `SPDX-ID` are specified, `license` wins.
5. The `pattern` is an optional regexp. You don’t need this if all the file headers are the same as `license` or the license of `SPDX-ID`, otherwise you need to compose a pattern that matches your license texts.
6. The `paths` are the path list that will be checked (and fixed) by license-eye, default is `['**']`. Formats like `**/*`.md and `**/bin/**` are supported.
7. The `paths-ignore` are the path list that will be ignored by license-eye. By default, `.git` and the content in `.gitignore` will be inflated into the `paths-ignore` list.
8. On what condition License-Eye will comment the check results on the pull request, `on-failure`, `always` or `never`. Options other than `never` require the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to be set.
9. `dependency` section is configurations for resolving dependencies' licenses.
10. `files` are the files that declare the dependencies of a project, typically, `go.mo` in Go project, `pom.xml` in maven project, and `package.json` in NodeJS project. If it's a relative path, it's relative to the `.licenserc.yaml`.

**NOTE**: When the `SPDX-ID` is Apache-2.0 and the owner is Apache Software foundation, the content would be [a dedicated license](https://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html#headers) specified by the ASF, otherwise, the license would be [the standard one](https://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html#Apply-My-Software).

## Supported File Types

The `header check` command theoretically supports all kinds of file types, while the supported file types of `header fix` command can be found [in this YAML file](assets/languages.yaml). In the YAML file, if the language has a non-empty property `comment_style_id`, and the comment style id is declared in [the comment styles file](assets/styles.yaml), then the language is supported by `fix` command.

- [assets/languages.yaml](assets/languages.yaml)

  ```yaml
  Java:
    type: programming
    tm_scope: source.java
    ace_mode: java
    codemirror_mode: clike
    codemirror_mime_type: text/x-java
    color: "#b07219"
    extensions:
      - ".java"
    language_id: 181
    comment_style_id: SlashAsterisk
  ```

- [assets/languages.yaml](assets/languages.yaml)

  ```yaml
  - id: SlashAsterisk     # (i)
    start: '/*'           # (ii)
    middle: ' *'          # (iii)
    end: ' */'            # (iv)
  ```

  1. The `comment_style_id` used in [assets/languages.yaml](assets/languages.yaml).
  2. The leading characters of the starting of a block comment.
  3. The leading characters of the middle lines of a block comment.
  4. The leading characters of the ending line of a block comment.

## Contribution

- If you find any file type should be supported by the aforementioned configurations, but it's not listed there, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/pulls) to add the configuration into the two files.
- If you find the license template of an SPDX ID is not supported, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/pulls) to add it into [the template folder](assets/header-templates).
