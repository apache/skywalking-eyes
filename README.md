## Usage

You can use License-Eye in GitHub Actions or in your local machine.

### GitHub Actions

First of all, add a `.licenserc.yaml` in the root of your project, for Apache Software Foundation projects, the following configuration should be enough.

> **Note**: The full configurations can be found in [the configuration section](#configurations).

```yaml
header:
  license:
    spdx-id: Apache-2.0
    copyright-owner: Apache Software Foundation

  paths-ignore:
    - 'dist'
    - 'licenses'
    - '**/*.md'
    - 'LICENSE'
    - 'NOTICE'

  comment: on-failure

# If you don't want to check dependencies' license compatibility, remove the following part
dependency:
  files:
    - pom.xml           # If this is a maven project.
    - Cargo.toml        # If this is a rust project.
    - package.json      # If this is a npm project.
    - go.mod            # If this is a Go project.
```

#### Check License Headers

To check license headers in GitHub Actions, add a step in your GitHub workflow.

```yaml
- name: Check License Header
  uses: apache/skywalking-eyes/header@main      # always prefer to use a revision instead of `main`.
  # with:
      # log: debug # optional: set the log level. The default value is `info`.
      # config: .licenserc.yaml # optional: set the config file. The default value is `.licenserc.yaml`.
      # token: # optional: the token that license eye uses when it needs to comment on the pull request. Set to empty ("") to disable commenting on pull request. The default value is ${{ github.token }}
      # mode: # optional: Which mode License-Eye should be run in. Choices are `check` or `fix`. The default value is `check`.
```

#### Fix License Headers

By default the action runs License-Eye in check mode, which will raise an error
if any of the processed files are missing license headers. If `mode` is set to
`fix`, the action will instead apply the license header to any processed file
that is missing a license header. The fixed files can then be pushed back to the
pull request using another GitHub action. For example:

```yaml
- name: Fix License Header
  uses: apache/skywalking-eyes/header@main
  with:
    mode: fix
- name: Apply Changes
  uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v4
  env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  with:
    author_name: License Bot
    author_email: license_bot@github.com
    message: 'Automatic application of license header'
```

> **Warning**: The exit code of fix mode is always 0 and can not be used to block CI
status. Consider running the action in check mode if you would like CI to fail
when a file is missing a license header.

> **Note**: In 0.3.0 and earlier versions, GitHub Actions `apache/skywalking-eyes`
> only works for header check/fix, since 0.4.0, we have a dedicate GitHub Actions
> `apache/skywalking-eyes/header` for header check/fix and a GitHub Actions
> `apache/skywalking-eyes/dependency` for dependency resolve/check.
> Now `apache/skywalking-eyes` is equivalent to `apache/skywalking-eyes/header` in
> order not to break existing usages of `apache/skywalking-eyes`.

#### Check Dependencies' License

To check dependencies license in GitHub Actions, add a step in your GitHub workflow.

```yaml
- name: Check Dependencies' License
  uses: apache/skywalking-eyes/dependency@main      # always prefer to use a revision instead of `main`.
  # with:
      # log: debug # optional: set the log level. The default value is `info`.
      # config: .licenserc.yaml # optional: set the config file. The default value is `.licenserc.yaml`.
      # mode: # optional: Which mode License-Eye should be run in. Choices are `check` or `resolve`. The default value is `check`.
      # flags: # optional: Extra flags appended to the command, for example, `--summary=path/to/template.tmpl`
```

### Docker Image

```shell
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace apache/skywalking-eyes header check
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace apache/skywalking-eyes header fix
```

### Docker Image from the latest codes

For users and developers who want to help to test the latest codes on main branch, we publish a Docker image to the GitHub
Container Registry for every commit in main branch, tagged with the commit sha. If it's the latest commit in main
branch, it's also tagged with `latest`.

**Note**: these Docker images are not official Apache releases. For official releases, please refer to
[the download page](https://skywalking.apache.org/downloads/#SkyWalkingEyes) for executable binary and
[the Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/skywalking-eyes) for Docker images.

```shell
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace ghcr.io/apache/skywalking-eyes/license-eye header check
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace ghcr.io/apache/skywalking-eyes/license-eye header fix
```

### Compile from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes
cd skywalking-eyes
make build
```

If you have the Go SDK installed, you can also use the `go install` command to install the latest code.

```bash
go install github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/cmd/license-eye@latest
```

#### Check License Header

```bash
license-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_check.yaml header check
```

#### Resolve Dependencies' licenses

This command assists human audits of the dependencies licenses. It's exit code is always 0.

It supports two flags:

| Flag name   | Short name | Description                                                                                                                            |
|-------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--output`  | `-o`       | Save the dependencies' `LICENSE` files to a specified directory so that you can put them in distribution package if needed.            |
| `--summary` | `-s`       | Based on the template, aggregate all dependency information and generate a `LICENSE` file.                                             |
| `--license` | `-l`       | The output path to the LICENSE file to be generated. The default summary format will be used if summary template file is not specified |

```bash
license-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_check.yaml dep resolve -o ./dependencies/licenses -s LICENSE.tpl
```

      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

1. The `header` section is configurations for source codes license header. If you have multiple modules or packages in your project that have differing licenses, this section may contain a list of licenses:
```yaml
header:
  - path: "/path/to/module/a"
    license:
      spdx-id: Apache-2.0
  - path: "/path/to/module/b"
    license:
      spdx-id: MPL-2.0
```
2. The [SPDX ID](https://spdx.org/licenses/) of the license, it’s convenient when your license is standard SPDX license, so that you can simply specify this identifier without copying the whole license `content` or `pattern`. This will be used as the content when `fix` command needs to insert a license header.
3. The copyright owner to replace the `[owner]` in the `SPDX-ID` license template.
4. The copyright software name to replace the `[software-name]` in the `SPDX-ID` license template.
5. If you are not using the standard license text, you can paste your license text here, this will be used as the content when `fix` command needs to insert a license header, if both `license` and `SPDX-ID` are specified, `license` wins.
6. The `pattern` is an optional regexp. You don’t need this if all the file headers are the same as `license` or the license of `SPDX-ID`, otherwise you need to compose a pattern that matches your existing license texts so that `license-eye` won't complain about the existing license headers. If you want to replace your existing license headers, you can compose a `pattern` that matches your existing license headers, and modify the `content` to what you want to have, then `license-eye header fix` would rewrite all the existing license headers to the wanted `content`.
7. The `paths` are the path list that will be checked (and fixed) by license-eye, default is `['**']`. Formats like `**/*`.md and `**/bin/**` are supported.
8. The `paths-ignore` are the path list that will be ignored by license-eye. By default, `.git` and the content in `.gitignore` will be inflated into the `paths-ignore` list.
9. On what condition License-Eye will comment the check results on the pull request, `on-failure`, `always` or `never`. Options other than `never` require the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to be set.
10. The `license-location-threshold` specifies the index threshold where the license header can be located.
11. The `language` is an optional configuration. You can set the language license header comment style. If it doesn't exist, it will use the default configuration at the `languages.yaml`. An [example](test/testdata/.licenserc_language_config_test.yaml) is to use block comment style for Go codes.
12. Specify the programming language identifier. You can set different configurations for multiple languages.
13. The `extensions` are the files with these extensions which the configuration will take effect.
14. The `filenames` are the specified files which the configuration will take effect.
15. The `comment_style_id` set the license header comment style, it's the `id` at the `styles.yaml`.
16. The `dependency` section is configurations for resolving dependencies' licenses.
17. The `files` are the files that declare the dependencies of a project, typically, `go.mod` in Go project, `pom.xml` in maven project, and `package.json` in NodeJS project. If it's a relative path, it's relative to the `.licenserc.yaml`.
18. Declare the licenses which cannot be identified by this tool.
19. The `name` of the dependency, The name is different for different projects, `PackagePath` in Go project, `GroupID:ArtifactID` in maven project, `PackageName` in NodeJS project. You can use file pattern as described in [the doc](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match).
20. The `version` of the dependency, comma seperated string (such as `1.0,2.0,3.0`), if this is empty, it means all versions of the dependency.
21. The [SPDX ID](https://spdx.org/licenses/) of the dependency license.
22. The minimum percentage of the file that must contain license text for identifying a license, default is `75`.
23. The dependencies that should be excluded when analyzing the licenses, this is useful when you declare the dependencies in `pom.xml` with `compile` scope but don't distribute them in package. (Note that non-`compile` scope dependencies are automatically excluded so you don't need to put them here).
24. The transitive dependencies brought by <23> should be recursively excluded when analyzing the licenses, currently only maven project supports this.
25. The copyright year of the work, if it's empty, it will be set to the current year. If you don't want to update the license year anually, you can set this to the year of the first publication of your work, such as `1994`, or `1994-2023`.

**NOTE**: When the `SPDX-ID` is Apache-2.0 and the owner is Apache Software foundation, the content would be [a dedicated license](https://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html#headers) specified by the ASF, otherwise, the license would be [the standard one](https://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html#Apply-My-Software).

## Supported File Types

The `header check` command theoretically supports all kinds of file types, while the supported file types of `header fix` command can be found [in this YAML file](assets/languages.yaml). In the YAML file, if the language has a non-empty property `comment_style_id`, and the comment style id is declared in [the comment styles file](assets/styles.yaml), then the language is supported by `fix` command.

- [assets/languages.yaml](assets/languages.yaml)

  ```yaml
  Java:
    type: programming
    tm_scope: source.java
    ace_mode: java
    codemirror_mode: clike
    codemirror_mime_type: text/x-java
    color: "#b07219"
    extensions:
      - ".java"
    language_id: 181
    comment_style_id: SlashAsterisk
  ```

- [assets/styles.yaml](assets/styles.yaml)

  ```yaml
  - id: SlashAsterisk     # (i)
    start: '/*'           # (ii)
    middle: ' *'          # (iii)
    end: ' */'            # (iv)
  ```

  1. The `comment_style_id` used in [assets/languages.yaml](assets/languages.yaml).
  2. The leading characters of the starting of a block comment.
  3. The leading characters of the middle lines of a block comment.
  4. The leading characters of the ending line of a block comment.

## Technical Documentation

- There is an [activity diagram](./docs/header_fix_logic.svg) explaining the implemented license header
  fixing mechanism in-depth. The diagram's source file can be found [here](./docs/header_fix_logic.plantuml).

## Contribution

- If you find any file type should be supported by the aforementioned configurations, but it's not listed there, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/pulls) to add the configuration into the two files.
- If you find the license template of an SPDX ID is not supported, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/pulls) to add it into [the template folder](assets/header-templates).
